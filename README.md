This github repo is a collection of Notebook demos to learn Julia.

- [Part 2](Part2-AdvancedJulia). Advanced Julia focuses on the main Julia features for fast computation.
- [Part 3](Part3-DataScience). Data Science in Julia is based on my previous meetup talks on Machine Learning and Data Modeling.
